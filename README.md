An interesting problem in computational geometry is that of the compatibility of graphs with a planar
straight-line embedding. We consider a tree with its leaves on the convex hull of its vertices and pose
the question of whether such a tree has a compatible cycle. This problem is of theoretical interest,
but not yet explored thoroughly. This report intents to build intuition about the problem and explores
several viable approaches to solving it. We look at a theoretical approach that uses existing theory on
Hamiltonian triangulations; we look at an algorithmic approach of iteratively forming such compatible
cycles and we prove the existence of a compatible cycle in a simplified scenario. The results of this
report build a basis for further research to continue solving this problem.
